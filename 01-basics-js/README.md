# Initial Project - JavaScript Strengthening

* The first thing to do after downloading the code is to run the command:

```
npm install
```
That command will download all the node modules needed to run the project.


* When it finishes installing the node_modules, then we can run the project with the following command

```
npm start
```

For that to work, remember to run that command in the same directory where the ````package.json``` is located.

## Change the port
By default, the port I set for this project is ```8081```, but if you need to change it because that port might be used by your computer, you can change it by opening ````package.json``` >> scripts. There you will see the instruction that launches the development server

```
"start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open --port=8081"
```

Just change the port to the one you need and you're done (logically save the changes before running ``npm start`` again).

# Specific section topics

This is a JavaScript reinforcement section, which is necessary to avoid feeling the learning curve of Vue.js complicated.

Specifically I want to reinforce the following topics:

1.- Constants, let and var

2.- Template literals

3.- Objects

4.- Arrays

5.- Functions

6.- Arrow functions

7.- Destructuring objects and arrays

8.- Imports and exports

9.- Promises

10.- Arguments to promises

11.- Value and reference

12.- Async and Await

13.- HTTP requests

14.- Ternary

15.- Null check
